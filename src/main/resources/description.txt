JDK Proxy was used in a following methods:
    * getUser(),
    * addUser(),
    * delete.
because JDK Proxy can only proxy by interface (so my target class needs to implement an interface, which is then also implemented by the proxy class).

CGLib Proxy wasn't used anywhere. It can create a proxy by subclassing. And my "project" include subclassing no one.
